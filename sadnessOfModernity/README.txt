About:
Lvl-Up is an interactive game about how there is always an illusion behind hierarchy. The player can play this game by using one black button. The purpose or goal of this game is for the player to try to push the button and get to the highest level. Before the player starts the game, he or she will see a line of text “ System: Push the button to join this reality.” After the player pushes the button the system will initialize a random number and tells you the top level you can reach in this game. For instance “ System: Your top level will be 37”. At the same time, the system will initialize another number, which it will not display to the player, but is actually the real top level the player can reach in this game. This means in the game, the real top level the player can get to may be above or below the level the system told you. Then, the player will see “Level 0” on the screen. In this game the player has to keep pushing the button to reach higher levels. If the player stops pushing the button, the level will decrease until it goes back to zero. 

In this game I’m using simple numbers as a metaphor of different classes in the capitalist society. Because of the game’s simplicity, many different sociological notions and concepts can be associated with this game. Once concept is about social class. According to Marxist Philosophy, class is about hierarchy, and is about objective and subjective factors. Marx thinks the two main classes in the capital society are the bourgeoisie and proletariat. In the case of my game, the bourgeoisie is the “system”. It tells the player which level they can reach. In the word of Marx, the system dictates the meaning of production. The proletariat, which is the player, has 
to keep pushing the button or keep working to stay or progress in status, which is created by the system. According to Max Weber, the term “class” is determined by economic position. It is also used to define our social status. In my game I try to express that many people are trapped into the class system, and all the meaning in life is about trying to get a higher economic position or a higher status. Another concept of the game is about the concept of a glass ceiling. This term is usually used to describe the unseen obstacles to the advancement and achievement of women and minority people in western society. (Federal Glass Ceiling Commission)
